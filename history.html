        <h1 id="history">History</h1>
        <hr id="rule">

        <p id="hisPage">Phi Beta Sigma Fraternity was founded at Howard University in Washington, D.C., January 9, 1914, by three young African-American male students. The Founders, Honorable A. L. Taylor,
            Honorable L. F. Morse, and Honorable C. I. Brown, wanted to organize a Greek letter fraternity that would truly exemplify the ideals of brotherhood, scholarship, and service.</p>

        <p id="hisPage">The Founders deeply wished to create an organization that viewed itself as “a part of” the general community rather than “apart from” the general community. They believed that each potential
            member should be judged by his own merits, rather than his family background or affluence…without regard to race, nationality, skin tone or texture of hair. They desired for their fraternity
            to exist as part of an even greater brotherhood which would be devoted to the “inclusive we” rather than the “exclusive we”.</p>

        <p id="hisPage">From its inception, the Founders also conceived Phi Beta Sigma as a mechanism to deliver services to the general community. Rather than gaining skills to be utilized exclusively for themselves
            and their immediate families, they held a deep conviction that they should return their newly acquired skills to the communities from which they had come. This deep conviction was mirrored in
            the Fraternity’s motto, “Culture For Service and Service For Humanity”.</p>

        <p id="hisPage">Today, Phi Beta Sigma has blossomed into an international organization of leaders. No longer a single entity, members of the Fraternity have been instrumental in the establishment of the
            Phi Beta Sigma National Foundation, the Phi Beta Sigma Federal Credit Union and The Sigma Beta Club Foundation. Zeta Phi Beta Sorority, founded in 1920 with the assistance of Phi Beta Sigma,
            is the sister organization of the Fraternity.</p>

        <h1 id="history">Sigma's International Programs</h1>
        <hr id="rule">

        <h2 id="intiatives">Bigger and Better Business</h2>

        <p id="hisPage">Bigger and Better Business became the first national program of Phi Beta Sigma Fraternity. It was first introduced to the fraternity at the Tenth Anniversary Conclave held in Philadelphia,
            Pennsylvania in December 1924. When Bigger and Better Business was adopted as a national program, special emphasis was placed on work with negro businesses. The main purpose at the time was
            to encourage negro business to improve their business acumen, efficiency and service to the public in order to favorably compete with other businesses.</p>

        <h2 id="intiatives">Social Action</h2>

        <p id="hisPage">Formulated in 1934, the Social Action program was conceived by Bro. Elmo M. Anderson to focus on improving the general well being of minority groups. The mission of the International
            Social Action Program is to encourage social, political and philanthropic leadership that strengthens our respective communities and our membership by:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Educating Fraternity members on health issues affecting them and their families.</li>
            <li>Increasing visibility and sense of self-worth by/through serving in the community.</li>
            <li>Providing unified efforts that address political and community issues and increasing
                awareness of the legislative process.</li>
            <li>Involving the membership in fund raising activities that support organizations that share
                our vision.</li>
            <li>Promoting health awareness in an effort to prevent health challenges amongst our
                membership.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="intiatives">Education</h2>

        <p id="hisPage">The basis of the Education program lies in the traditional emphasis that the Fraternity places on education. During the 1945 Conclave in St. Louis, Missouri, the Fraternity underwent
            a constitution restructuring which led to the birth of education as an international program. The program focuses on programming and services to alumni and collegiate in the Fraternity. Programs
            such as scholarships, lectures, college fairs, mentoring and tutoring enhance this program on local, regional and national levels.
